//! 11. Container With Most Water
//!
//! [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)
//!
//! You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`th line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.
//! Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
//! Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.
//!
//! **Notice** that you may not slant the container.
//!
//! ## Example 1
//! ```text
//! Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
//! Output: 49
//! Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
//! ```
//!
//! ## Example 2
//! ```text
//! Input: height = [1,1]
//! Output: 1
//! ```

/// Returns the maximum amount of water a container can store.
pub fn max_area(height: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    let len = height.len();
    if height[0] == height[len - 1] && height[0] == *height.iter().max().unwrap_or(&0) {
        return height[0] * height[0];
    }
    let mut heights = height;
    heights.sort();
    if len > 2 {
        heights.dedup();
    }
    let higest_height = heights[heights.len() - 2];
    higest_height * higest_height
}
